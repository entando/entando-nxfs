### Running the server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
go run main.go
```

To run the server in a docker container

```
docker-compose up
```

By default, the browsable file system path is set to the local folder browsableFS, but you can update it in the docker-compose.yml file.
You can proceed in 2 ways:

1. by binding the mounted volume to your desired folder
2. by passing the `BROWSABLE_FS` environment variable to the container

The environment variable will have precedence over the volume
